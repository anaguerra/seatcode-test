# SEAT:CODE Test

## Summary

**Installation and execution**

1) Clone the repository
2) `make start` . Start containers
3) `make prepare`. Install dependencies
4) `make run-tests`

**Summary**

- The code is located in `src` and the tests are in `tests`.
- Some improvements could be done but for the purposes of the test I think that is enough so you can see how I develop.
